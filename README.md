## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css//) - modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets

### What I learned

I was really tempted to over-engineer this and try using a NodeJS package to grab the Advice Slip API - but keeping it simple seemed to be the most effectice method, and it was nice to just utilise some basic JavaScript.

### Continued development

I'll attempt another JS challenge to keep my skills fresh. On the front-end side, I don't think index.html would be considered as semantic so I would like to focus on making sure I'm using semantic markup when using HTML.

### Useful resources
